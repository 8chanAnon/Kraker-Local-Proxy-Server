<b>On this day of August 13, 2024</b>
<p>
Sigh. I've been battling YouTube because of IP address blocking and rate
limiting. My own proxy server is blocked permanently because it resides in an Amazon cloud. The substitute proxy
works but it gets rate limited. When that happens, the YouTube Player just won't work until the rate limit is lifted. The
new plan involves upgrading my proxy server so it can work through a socks5 proxy to hide the Amazon IP address. The upgrade
is done and working wonderfully. I have managed to find a handful of socks5 proxies that I can use. Most of them are pretty
unreliable but a couple are turning out to be dependable and fast. When the app opens, it picks the first proxy on the list
which is the best one. If that stops responding or if it gets rate limited then the app will rotate to the next proxy
on the list. Working good so far.
<p>
The problem with finding suitable proxies is that the majority are already blacklisted by YouTube. I might find 10 working
proxies but only one will be usable. It's a tedious process though I have this really nifty proxy checking tool which
will be one of the apps that you will get totally for free when I finally release my Kraker package. I don't know if any
of you are anticipating the release but I'm getting spurts of traffic here. Sometimes there's no traffic for a couple of
days and then there's a few dozen visitors. I don't know from where but it's nice to see.
<p>
In related news, I had to remove some of the U.S. TV channels from the Free TV & Movies playlist. The source is no longer
working. There are three other sources available but they require the local proxy server to work. There is only so much that
can be accomplished with a remote proxy.
<p>
On that note, some people might be wondering why I don't just write this stuff as a desktop app, free of the browser
restrictions. Well, that sounds nice but it's just trading one problem for another. I'm already offering you a desktop app
in the form of a proxy server so how does it make a difference to package everything as a desktop app? Besides that, my
apps need support for graphics, networking and video playback. Where should that support come from? The support is already
there in the web browser. I don't have to go searching for libraries to do what needs to be done. Despite the issues (and
there are many), I think the browser is an excellent development environment. Besides that, cracking these websites often
involves running Javascript which is easily done inside the browser but difficult and extremely error-prone otherwise. There
are a few pirate sites that could only be cracked by running a modified version of the Javascript inside an <i>iframe</i>
and extracting the video information by trapping an exit point. This would be impossible to do outside of the browser.
So, yeah, there is logic in my insanity.
<p>
Anyway, thanks for visiting. There is more to come.

<b>On this day of August 9, 2024</b>
<p>
So I've been working on a new installation tutorial for the <g_>Kraker Local
Proxy Server</g_> and I've realized the need for some hands-on examples of powerful apps. Previously, I've just been
telling people to play around with Alleycat Player to see what the proxy server is good for but that is really insufficient.
For one thing, Alleycat Player does not exercise the advanced capabilities of the proxy and, even if it did, you wouldn't
even know without me telling you. Some small but useful apps as a demonstration of what the proxy can do would go a long
way. I already made one which is useful for browsing files on the local disk but I've kind of been at a loss for what to do
for a larger demonstration. Then it struck me that I should make an M3U playlist reader. I've been needing that because it
has been a pain in the ass to find working Internet TV channels by browsing through the barely readable text of an M3U file
in Notepad and copying the URL into Alleycat Player to test it. Well, now I have such an app and it makes the previous apps
that I made for TV and movies obsolete. I am offering you over 200 links for Internet TV, movies and some radio stations as
well. You can also make your own playlist or just use whatever you can find on the Internet.
<p>
All of these apps make use of a scaled-down remote version of my local proxy server. It is hosted by Vercel which, in turn,
is hosted by Amazon. It is a simple matter to block the proxy by the IP address and a number of websites are doing this
right now. I had a hard time finding a pirate movie source because the ones that I'd already hacked are blocking my proxy.
Either that or the hack is too involved anyway to be workable with a remote proxy. This blocking is actually news to me and
it must have started over the course of the past few months. Whenever I hack a site, I always check to see
whether or not it is workable with a remote proxy.
<p>
On August 6, YouTube started blocking my proxy and the YouTube Player app stopped working. I got it working again by a
stroke of pure luck. This story is a bit long so buckle up. It is very informative and it goes along with what I said in
my rant further down this page: "The Internet is getting tougher and more user-unfriendly". Everybody wants to lock you in
and part of the process is blocking what is called "headless apps". This means bots and scrapers which normally operate
without human intervention. My own utilities are, of course, not headless but they appear as such to websites. Jealous
website operators do not want you using unauthorized apps to access their sites. One way to block these evil apps is to
block the IP addresses belonging to data centres like Amazon Web Services. This is easily done with a list of all the data
centre IPs, as well as the IPs of all known proxy servers. Google has such a list since they've been blocking data centre
IPs from using Google search for at least the past couple of years and now they're doing the same for YouTube. Cloudflare
also has the list and many pirate websites are hosted there. I think there has been a pricing or policy change at Cloudflare
and that's why these pirate sites are now blocking my remote proxy whereas they did not have that ability prior to, say,
six months ago. So the problem that I had was finding another proxy server which is not blocked by YouTube.
<p>
A few years ago, finding proxy servers was not difficult. Alleycat Player offered five proxy servers before I built my own
at Vercel. They have all disappeared except for "api.allorigins.win" which has somehow resisted whatever abuses took down
the others. Unfortunately, that one was also blocked by YouTube so I was left with no options. The YouTube Player could not
be fixed. Just prior to offering the app for free movies, I discovered that the source (thetvapp.to) that I was using for
U.S. channels in the TV app is no longer accessible. It is blocked by a Cloudflare bot challenge. The challenge can
be bypassed using the local proxy server but that is not possible with the remote version.
<p>
This is an <a href="https://fmhy.net/videopiracyguide">excellent resource</a> for finding pirate sites. There is this one
interesting site (www.braflix.ru) which turned out to be somewhat more than just interesting. For one, it is a proxy for
the previously mentioned site which is now blocked by Cloudflare. Secondly, not only is my remote proxy server not blocked
but the video link itself goes through a proxy. I don't know why because the proxy is not needed. My app tosses away the
proxy wrapper. What is important is that this proxy is not blocked by YouTube. Thus, the YouTube Player has been fixed
though only partially. Age-gated videos no longer work because the new proxy does not accept the POST method. There were
issues already with some videos not working because of the IP address mismatch between the proxy server and the user.
Anyway, after all this I now find that "api.allorigins.win" is no longer blocked. I don't know why. It turns out that
it is hosted by Cloudflare but so is the other one that I used to fix the YouTube Player. What's going on?
<p>
I'll end this long story with a note. The nature of the block is not that the YouTube server refuses to deliver the file.
Rather, it delivers the file without the links to the video. This triggers the app to assume that the video is age-gated
and so it goes through a different route which also turns out to be blocked in a similar fashion. So the remote proxy server
works in one instance but not in the other. All of this works just fine with the local proxy server. I could be wrong but
I'm assuming for now that the difference is the IP address and nothing more.
<p>
The new app retains the functionality that I introduced with the Free Movies app. The zoom feature is the
same and I've included an additional level to the brightness control. The custom video control is unchanged. You can select
360p, 480p or 720p. You can load a playlist or save a playlist. The app should be able to load any playlist that you find
on the Internet. The playlist is saved with just the channel name and the URL. That is, it cleans up the list, removing the
other garbage that makes the playlist very hard to manage in a text editor.
<p>
On startup, the app loads a default playlist from the GitHub server. As protection from the psychotic copyright warriors,
the playlist is encoded on the server. I already got hit once with a DMCA notice on Alleycat Player and I don't want to
risk that again because the way it went down is that I had to delete and restore the entire repository. Of course, I have
my own local copies of everything and backups on a file storage service.
<p>
The radio stations in the default playlist are mostly HTTP. Since the app is loaded from HTTPS, your browser will likely not
allow HTTP audio or video because web browsers are becoming increasingly and more stupidly strict (for your safety, of
course, and not because design by committee leads to total bullshit). You can, however, open the audio link in a new tab.
This issue does not exist with the local proxy server.

In unrelated news, my neighborhood is starting to look like a jungle again. All of the gardens are overgrowing the
walkways. Trees are growing where there were no trees. It's crazy. The threat of carbon dioxide is not global warming but
the prospect of being buried alive by excess vegetation.

<b>On this day of July 31, 2024</b>
<p>
I'm here to drop another gift, this time offering some new movies to watch. It's
similar to the Free TV app that I posted last time but for movies. I invested quite a bit of effort on finding a source that
doesn't need the local proxy server because most of them go out of their way to prevent somebody like me from bypassing their
shitty websites infested with popups, adware and malware. Some of them block certain IP addresses that belong to data
centres which are often used for web scraping. Or they may hide behind a bot wall, courtesy of Cloudflare. Anyway,
I've got a list of 16 recently released movies to entertain you for a while.
<p>
There is a particular issue with watching movies on a PC with a web browser. This issue is High Dynamic Range (HDR) versus
Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). HDR has to be supported by your monitor and video card and maybe the browser in order to work.
I don't understand the details but it's a big mess. What little research that I've done on the issue indicates that there
are a LOT of problems even when you have the hardware and software support for HDR. There are conflicting standards and the
support could be of such low quality that it hardly improves the viewing experience. For me, I have an old system with a CRT
so I'm far from venturing into HDR. I'm kind of clueless.
<p>
What I do know is that you can tell when a video is intended to be viewed as HDR when it comes up very dark and
over-saturated. I don't know if the pirate sites are actually dishing out properly encoded HDR or just SDR transcoded
from HDR. I'm not familiar with the process of how they rip the content from the official DVDs or streaming sites.
In any case, watching movies on a non-HDR system can be an exercise in misery but it doesn't have to be. While it is not an
ideal solution, it is possible to brighten and desaturate the video to make it watchable. That is, the video can be balanced
using the brightness, contrast and saturation settings in CSS. Unfortunately, gamma is not one of the options and it would
be a lot better with gamma but we can get most of the way to something tolerable. A full solution would require tinkering
with the video at the pixel level.
<p>
I have provided a single option in the app to brighten the video and it is a solution that will work satisfactorily most
of the time. Dark areas may still be too dark and bright areas will definitely be too bright but this is the best that can
be done. At least you'll be able to see what's going on and you won't be worrying about it much if the movie is any good.
<p>
Another issue is the super-wide format which is only suitable for theatres. It is horrible on a 4:3 monitor and annoying
on a 16:9 monitor. I've added an option to zoom the video to fit the vertical space. Obviously, this will crop the video
horizontally but you will barely notice. These two options, zoom and brighten, are not available anywhere else so I command
you to enjoy this limited-time offer.

<p>
<b><r_>Stay tuned!</r_> <g_>The best is yet to come!</g_></b>
<p></p>
In the next few weeks, this place will come back to life after being put on hold more than a year ago. Why have I been away?
The answer is complicated but I won't bore you with a long story. Suffice to say that my software projects failed to attract
sufficient interest, to the point that I was working in the dark with no feedback whatsoever nor even any idea if anybody
has been using my software beyond an initial trial. I decided to just stop releasing code and to just take my time to make
everything better. This has been difficult because, as I said, there has been no feedback so I've been left to guess on my
own what features people may want or what features weren't working as intended.
<p></p>
Alleycat Player is not dead. I've been keeping it up to date insofar as it serves my needs. I still use it to play all of
my videos. I never play videos on YouTube or Bitchute or Rumble or any other site. I don't like the site designs and I
despise the ads (I'll never understand why a simple banner in the sidebar is not good enough). I watch my movies and TV
shows by stealing the video links from the pirate sites. My needs are being met. It's too bad that nobody else has been
benefiting. Really, all anybody had to do was drop me a message asking for an update and I would have obliged. I'm sad
that nobody bothered.
<p></p>
The Kraker Local Proxy Server is the reason why Alleycat Player has been able to do what no other browser app has ever done.
However, it seems that a lot of people have regarded the proxy server with suspicion, like it was going to mess around with
their OS or do nasty things in secret. I guess I can't blame them. We do need to be careful about what we install on our
machines. In any case, my aim has been to beef up the proxy server to make it an indispensible tool and not just a sidekick
to my video player.
<p></p>
Those who have survived through the many DNS outages on 8kun will remember the advice about updating the "hosts" file. Who
supplied the IP address for that? I did. How did I know? The Kraker proxy helped with that. I'm just trying to say that the
tool was always intended as a bit more than a crutch for Alleycat Player. The problem has been the lack of any apps to
demonstrate the features. As long as I'm tooting my own horn, some anons might (fondly) remember the 8kun Authentigator and
the spy-versus-spy scenarios (it was fun and no hard feelings, Jim).
<p></p>
My biggest problem right now is finishing the documentation. After over a year of work, there is a LOT to document.
Documentation is important but it's more important that it be written clearly and concisely so that people don't need to be
software engineers to grasp the concepts. That's hard but I can say that the hardest parts have been completed. It should
go a lot more smoothly from here on. I just need to kick myself to get it done. That's why I'm committing myself with
this post. Please yell at me if I take too long.

<b>On this day of September 29, 2022</b>
<p>
So I have a new version of the <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> ready to go and a new app called <g_>Meme Finder</g_>.
Both of these use the new "shadow port" feature on the <g_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</g_>. The last version (2e) of
the Bread Launcher works fine from a local file (with stated limitations) and that won't change for the next version.
The Meme Finder will absolutely require the proxy server although you won't be required to proxy all of your browser
activity through it (but you should because it's great for DNS). The Finder comes with a really nifty image gallery
viewer and will handle any number of folders as long as you don't have too many memes in any one folder (you should
be fine with a few thousand but 10,000 is crazy).
<p>
I discovered that, contrary to my expectations, the last version of the Bread Launcher does not work on Chrome-based
browsers (I use Brave for testing). Works just fine on Firefox and that's what I use. Mozilla isn't a bitch trying to
piss all over developers like the Chrome guys. I don't know how much influence Google has on Chrome development but
I'm certainly not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. It smells like Google has something up their sleeve
with this obsession with third-party cookies.
<p>
But I'm getting ahead of myself. The problem with third-party cookies is that a lot of websites use them
indiscriminately to track people around the Internet. I'm not seeing what the big deal is since browsers are already
blocking trackers of all kinds so why don't they just block these suspicious cookies? Instead of doing that, Chrome
is going for the big guns and killing third-party cookies altogether. They've been talking about this for a while but
I haven't paid any attention because I didn't really care. Now I care because it's causing me grief with the Bread
Launcher and the cookies that 8kun is using for the captcha. Firefox is not fussy about third-party cookies so it
works fine but Brave is being a bastard. I wouldn't mind so much if I could use a site permission to get around the
issue but, nah, no soup for you. Why not?
<p>
The whole motivation for developing the proxy server for <g_>Alleycat Player</g_> is the
inability to flag local files as trusted. I wouldn't even mind if the permission had to be on the basis of
individual files because Alleycat is just one damn file anyway. There should be a checkbox somewhere that says "let
this app do whatever it damn well pleases". Drop all restrictions and let the app fly. After all, if I build a
desktop app, there would not be any such restrictions. Why can't I have free rein on my browser? Why do the browser
makers have to be so bitchy about it?
<p>
I'll tell you why. They think you are too stupid to be trusted. They think you'll get scammed by some Nigerian prince
with a money problem and that he'll convince you to install something that fucks up your system. What else could it be?
I can't have a checkbox for my apps because they think I'm stupid. Quite frankly, I don't care all that much if other
people use my apps. I just want to build them how I want and not have to bend over backwards because of browser
restrictions. This is the sort of shit that leads to workarounds like extensions (which they want to block too)
and my <g_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</g_> which wouldn't be needed at all except that I can't have that checkbox.
<p>
Enough ranting. I love my proxy server and I don't want to be without it. Whatever the cunts at Mozilla and
Google decide to do, I'll find a workaround. Anyway, the issue with third-party cookies being blocked on Brave means
that full functionality isn't possible without faking an <g_>8kun.top</g_> domain using a shadow port. I call it
<g_>get.8kun.top</g_> and Brave thinks it's a real 8kun domain and so it doesn't block the cookies. It's pretty trivial
to set up the shadow ports (one is also needed for <g_>sys.8kun.top</g_>). I had to make a fix in the proxy server
for the cookie problem and now there is a new fix needed for proper Youtube playback because Brave doesn't allow access
to "localhost" under the 8kun domain (another thing that Firefox is lax about).
<p>
In order for all of this to work, the browser needs to proxy all content through the proxy server. It's the only way.
The bonus is that you get a great DNS manager and other features as part of the deal so it's not like you'll be tied
down to the proxy just for the sake of using one or two of my apps. Besides that, you'll be planning for the future.
Whatever happens to the Internet, I'll be here countering the totalitarian tendencies of our overseers.

<b>On this day of August 1, 2022</b>
<p>
I just completed the final touches on the documentation for the <g_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</g_>. Huge sigh of
relief because I won't be having to work on the docs anymore. I don't much enjoy writing docs because I'm not a
writer and I have trouble finding the right words sometimes (and I'm never sure that I've succeeded). Anyway, I
ended with a little rant about Cloudflare and their goddamn Bot Fight Mode. Here it is:
<p>
I hate (HATE!) the Cloudflare bot protection. In the case of an HTTP connection, it is no protection at all, really.
I discovered that Cloudflare looks at certain header names for proper case usage. The affected headers are: Host,
User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language and Connection. I wrote some code to correct these headers and
put them at the beginning of the header stack.
<p>
Header names are converted to lower case by Node.js and this makes sense since the HTTP specifications state that
case in header names is not significant. It also makes my code easier to write since case does not need to be
considered. A server is not supposed to reject an HTTP transaction based on the case of header names but we're not
talking about normality anymore. It is war out there and Cloudflare is determined to win no matter what sort of
inconvenience that incurs. Ignore the specs? Sure, why not? I shouldn't be having to do this.
<p>
My main target is <g_>https://banned.video</g_>. This is an Infowars site and it gave me a problem a while back
until I discovered an alternative domain (Infowars has a lot of them). Without fixing the headers, the HTTP
version of the site simply returns a status 403 and no data. With the header fix, the site will relocate to the
HTTPS version. That's progress since I can access another unrelated site that doesn't mind doing HTTP. However,
I cannot get into the HTTPS version of that other site. I get stopped dead with not even a bot challenge to solve.
<p>
The problem with HTTPS is the negotiation (or TLS handshake) that is needed to establish an encrypted connection.
The negotiation protocol is open-ended, meaning that there are a million ways to do it. This means that the
specifics of the negotiation can be used to "fingerprint" the incoming connection. In much the same way, browsers
can be fingerprinted based on the details of HTML rendering. So Cloudflare takes a fingerprint of the TLS handshake
and will reject the connection if the handshake doesn't look like it is coming from a web browser. This is a big deal
because it locks out Node.js and, really, any tool which is not based on browser code. It locks out non-transparent
proxy servers so banned.video cannot be accessed through a corporate proxy and I don't know why Infowars
doesn't care about that customer base. For that matter, I don't understand what the problem is in the first place.
It's been like this for two years but I never heard of a bot attack on Infowars. I'm sure they get attacked from
time to time but sheesh.
<p>
There are actually very few sites that do this. Most of the ones that I have seen are pirate video sites. That seems
to be a pattern since Banned Video is also a video site. It suggests that web scraping might be the issue and not
any kind of attack. Whatever. I can't figure out how to get into the site. There is no bot challenge, just a hard
stop. There is currently no tool to modify the TLS handshake in Node.js and this seems to apply across the board
though it apparently can be done with Golang (also known as Go). In any case, I'm not inclined to bother with trying
to solve the Cloudflare bot challenge since I'm not even getting that far with the sites that I want to hack.
Whatever. This is <b_>The End</b_> for now.
<p>
The HTTP Toolkit guy has more info <a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/tls-fingerprinting-node-js/">here</a>.
(Note: his advice on bypassing the fuckery is outdated. Unfortunately.)

<b>News item for June 13, 2022</b>
<p>
Kraker v4b is now available. This is a code fix (see my June 11 rant). It is a truly powerful proxy server that goes way
beyond the needs of Alleycat Player (which still does not require a Kraker version later than the first one). The
Kraker proxy is a product that now stands on its own merit and not just as an addon for the player. It is likely the
most powerful proxy server designed for personal use. I just need to figure out how to attract some attention
to it. As it is, very few people know or care. Well, that seems to be true for all of my software projects since I
have started working on them.
<p>
Funny thing happened. There are two projects in my archive.org repository that suddenly got a lot of attention without
any action on my part. The Black Box project (old BBC TV program) has 5 stars and almost a thousand page views. I
have no bleeping idea where this interest came from. My Europa project has 15 stars and is nearing 5000 page views.
The interest started around February and it might be because of a comment to a Youtube video (no idea what video). What
does this mean? Should I get an account on Youtube and start posting comments? Like where should I post to get traffic
to this site? Meh. I don't relish the idea of running around promoting this. Fame isn't my goal and I'm not sure that
I really want to manage a horde of curious people who don't have the mental capacity to understand what I'm offering.
Not that I think people are really stupid. It's just that most of them make no effort to understand something before
trashing, commending or criticizing. I'm not a cat herder.

<p><hr><p>

<b> On this day of June 11, 2022</b>
<p>
Time for a rant. This is about Node.js which is the development tool that I use to implement the Kraker Local
Proxy Server. I have one favourable comment about this tool: it works flawlessly once you figure out what to do and what
not to do. So far, no mysterious crashes or hangups that can't be traced to something that I did "wrong". On the other
hand, the documentation is FUBAR (fucked up beyond all repair). Half of the specs don't actually apply, perhaps because
the tool has gone through too many revisions. Event handling is the biggest headache. Also, it is difficult to understand
where memory leaks come from because important stuff like proper socket destruction is barely touched on. You are given
the impression that everything just works so you don't need to worry your little head with picayune details like
"did I close that socket properly or not?". The biggest snafu is the HTTP Request module. What a mess. Important
revisions took place with Node.js v13 and v16 that aren't documented. You're just supposed to know about them by
following the developer forum, I guess.
<p>
These revisions are anything but minor. They are code-breaking and figuring out how to get around that can involve
a lot of experimentation to find the differences so that the code can be reworked to compensate. With v13, the timing
of some events was changed. When an HTTP transaction is passed down from the HTTP server, there are two forks: the
request fork and the response fork. The first one receives the headers and data FROM the caller while the second
sends the headers and data back TO the caller. It's a good division of labour and I'm not complaining about that. The
difficulty lies in knowing when one or the other has completed processing. This is what events are for. They signal
when something important has occurred. Now, don't get me wrong. The changes in v13 are justified and I'm surprised
that it took so many versions between 10.0.0 and 13.0.0 to figure this shit out.
<p>
The important difference for me is that the response fork emits a "close" event in v10 only when the response is
aborted (usually because the destination server closed the socket). In v13, the event is emitted always when the
response completes. Big difference if your code is relying on the event to detect an aborted as opposed to a
completed transaction. Another change occurred in v16. An aborted HTTP transaction <b>no longer closes the
underlying sockets</b>. This is a biggie and I can't understand why they made such a change so late in the game.
This behavioural change should have been made optional because it is abso-fucking-lutely code-breaking. I wasted
several hours of my time trying to figure out an elegant solution to this which won't break compatibility with
earlier versions. My code is designed to be compatible with all Node.js versions from v10 up to the latest version.
I need to carefully craft the code to handle any discrepancies between versions. I refuse to be put in the situation
of having to inform my users that, hey, you should upgrade your copy of Node.js because I'm too lazy to fix my code.
I just don't operate that way unless I can find no other alternative.
<p>
End of rant. I'm quite pleased with the final outcome. I have finally rid the code of all traces of memory leakage
(crosses fingers). My goal of maintaining a memory footprint of around 15MB seems to have been achieved. Now, this
is actually pretty important. I have read many complaints about excessive memory usage and I have no doubt that
this is due to a lack of understanding of how Node.js handles events and socket closures. The horror stories of
Node.js apps consuming hundreds of megabytes can be traced to these memory leaks. It's the same problem that I've
been struggling with over the last few versions of my proxy server app. When I first built the proxy, it was only
for the sake of Alleycat Player so the actual usage was low and thus the opportunity for memory leaks was low also.
With the inclusion of the Socks5 proxy, DNS support and other features, I now have ALL activity from my web browser
streaming through the proxy server. Memory leakage is therefore a more important issue than it was.
<p>
Granted, the browser consumes 20 to 50 times the memory but I'm a stickler for perfection. Anyway, if you're a
budding amateur developer who has dabbled with or is planning to dabble with Node.js then you should think seriously
about carefully studying my code. It might help you to understand what you're doing wrong before you do it.
Good luck and please don't hesitate to drop me an email with any questions you may have. After all, what is the point
of doing what I'm doing if it is not to help someone (hopefully a lot of someones)?

Oh my goodness! The DMCA notice references the blobs in my repository rather than the canonical paths. What this
means is that modifying or deleting the files makes no difference. I would need to install a tool to prune the
GitHub history tree to removed the blobs. If you don't understand what I'm talking about then join the club.
I ended up deleting the entire repository and rebuilding it because that was easier than figuring out how to
delete the history or the blobs or whatever it is I was supposed to do. I hope this doesn't happen again.

Wow! Got hit with a DMCA notice today. This affects versions of Alleycat Player from v4b to v5b. Corus Entertainments
doesn't like having their free Global News feeds passed around the Internet. A great many IPTV playlists are affected
all over GitHub. For the time being, I have removed all of the affected copies of Alleycat except for v5b from which I
have removed the Global News link. I'm thinking of using a simple algorithm to obfuscate the link so that Corus won't
be able to find it again. They're obviously just using a simple string search to find the links. Obfuscation won't work
for all of those playlists though. The DMCA notice lists a few hundred. Geez, what a needless
headache for the GitHub management.
<p>
The DMCA notice is here: <a href="dl/2022-06-06-corus.txt">Plain Text</a>
or <a href="dl/2022-06-06-corus.rtf">Rich Text Format</a>

Oh man! So long since I've typed something here. I just finished a massive update on the Kraker Local Proxy Server
instruction manual. There is a LOT to document with the new update to version 4a (and I still have a few more things
to cover but this is enough for now). Kraker isn't just a side tool for Alleycat Player anymore. It's now in the big leagues
and deserving of some kind of an award. If I do say so myself, kek.
<p>
Anyway, I'm tired right now but I'll be back soon to post my thoughts. Stay tuned, fren.

Alleycat Player will be two years old on December 7. Hard to believe that it's been that long. As noted on the main
page, the installation and user manuals have been updated. This was way overdue and I've had to really drag
myself to the task after leaving it aside for over a year. Now it's done and I can kick back with quart of tequila and
celebrate all the hard work I've put into this. Hope somebody appreciates it. Later.

I had to upload a new update for the 8kun Bread Launcher because I found some issues with Chrome-based browsers.
The problem is that Chrome is a dog at opening new tabs and preparing the DOM. It reports that it is ready
when it is not. This forces me to place extra checks and timeouts to make sure that the DOM is actually ready to be
modified correctly. If I don't do this, I get the wrong values for things like the width or height of an element.
This causes two problems when opening a new tab: the title in the status bar may not appear and images may be
placed on the wrong side (the right instead of the left).
<p>
Another thing is that Chrome is stubborn about timers running in a page. It wants to slow them down when the page
is in the background. That's fine. I understand how some web developers will abuse timers. However, a timer
should only be slowed down if it consumes a lot of CPU. The auto-update timer in the Launcher does not consume CPU
until it hits zero. There is no good reason to slow it down but Chrome is dumb and stupid about it. Anyway, the
solution is to move the timer out of the main page and into the daughter page (because the main page is running
in the background). It's just one line of code. Chrome will only slow it down if the daughter page goes to the
background. Which is still wrong but it is at least tolerable.

I am pleased to announce that the 8kun Bread Launcher finally supports posting. This is just a preliminary update.
The posting feature is not yet full-featured but that'll come in the next week or so. Barring head-scratching
complications, of course, and I've had a lot of them with this update. HTML and CSS never cease to present me
with browser compatibility problems. For example, it turns out that Chrome browsers put a little blank space below
the &lt;textarea&gt; element that should not be there. I had to hit the Internet to find a solution which was to
add the setting "vertical-align:top" to the CSS for the element. Really??? Why do these things happen? Oh well. At
least we are past the bad old days of Internet Explorer and Netscape.
<p>
Something is totally buggered with the "XMLHttpRequest" component. This is used to implement the posting operation.
I could have used "fetch", which is what I would normally do, but I wanted to implement an upload progress indicator
and that is not possible with "fetch". I got the indicator working but it doesn't actually work. I know it doesn't
work in Firefox and I haven't bothered to test with the other browsers but my research on the net seems to indicate
that this is a problem all around. The problem is with the "onprogress" callback which doesn't fire at
regular intervals and often indicates the wrong amount of progress. I mean, it'll jump to 62% done right off the bat
and then not fire again. Shit like that. Oh well, at least the uploading works.

<b> On this day of September 17, 2021</b>
<p>
I encountered a peculiar artifact while I was revamping the HTML for the Alleycat main page. My goal was to keep
the text in a panel separate from the image in the same panel such that, if you zoom in (or if the user forces a
larger font), the text won't wrap around the image as the panel expands vertically. Also, the image will remain
centered. The only practical way to achieve such is to use a table format. An odd thing happened due to the inclusion
of a table inside the panel. A 5-pixel-tall space appeared below the bottom border of each panel.
<p>
It was not my CSS that caused this spatial displacement. There was absolutely no reason for it and the artifact
appeared in different browsers. In Firefox, the spacing varied by a pixel (arrgh). Originally, the panels were
constructed with a &lt;div&gt; tag so I simply built the table inside the div. Removing the div and transferring
the CSS to the &lt;table&gt; tag cleared up the problem. I have no idea what went wrong but I guess I should be
happy that it is now fixed.
<p>
I have a similar issue with Alleycat Player and it may be due to the way the table format conflicts with something
else in the video viewers. All three viewers should be displayed exactly the same but they are not. There is
one out of the three which has a slight difference somewhere. This varies with different browsers. It's been months
and I still can't figure it out. Grrrrr.
<p>
<b>Addendum:</b> After writing the above, I discovered something else. The problem was caused by declaring
"display:inline-block" in the CSS for the div. The artifact goes away with "display:block". Alternatively,
the declaration "vertical-align:middle" also works. Why???

The <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> has been updated in response to a recent change to the media server on 8kun. The media
server went down at 3PM on August 26 and was restored on September 13 after a downtime of 18 days and 4.5 hours. The
new domain for the media server is "images.128ducks.com". This condition is only temporary. Who knows how temporary?
