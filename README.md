# Kraker Local Proxy Server

This is a proxy server designed for use with desktop web browsers. It was originally intended as a support tool for Alleycat Player. It has expanded to include many advanced features for general-purpose browsing and for web sraping. It is implemented in Node.js (tested on versions 10 to 20). There are no dependencies and the entire code base is contained in a single Javascript file (about 104K in size).

## Use the proxy in your browser for access to these features:

- configurable DNS manager with support for DNS-over-HTTPS
- route specific domains through another Socks5 or HTTP proxy
- use Tor, I2P and normal Internet with the same web browser
- ability to pin the SSL certificate for sensitive domains
- intercept websites for analysis or enhancement

## Additional features:

- access to the local file system (with strong security to prevent abuse)
- websocket for global messaging and tool support
- cryptographic support for RSA and AES
