# Kraker Local Proxy Server

This is a local proxy server designed for use with desktop web browsers. It was originally intended as a support tool for Alleycat Player. It has expanded to include many advanced features for general website hacking. Also includes a Socks5 proxy server with integrated DNS and DNS-over-HTTPS. Supports TOR and I2P. Supports IP address masking via third-party proxies. A new feature called "shadow ports" supports website mimicry in the web browser.

This tool is implemented in Node.js (tested on versions 10 to 16). There are no dependencies and the entire code base is contained in a single Javascript file (about 55K in size).

This repository is new. I will upload the latest version of the app shortly (just in case somebody wanders by while I'm still working on it).
